# TASK: Actions on the file 'prices.txt' in python

## Description:
**Easy Level**

In this level, you will read the data from prices.txt (see additional files),  compute the total price of all items, and count the total number of purchased items. 

*! If you don't know how to deal with non integer characters, remove them manually from the file !*

**Medium Level**
In this level, we will extend the program to skip rows that contain anything other than a number in the code. (Modify your program in such a way that all rows that contain something else than a number, are skipped.)
